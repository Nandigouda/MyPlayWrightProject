# 🎯 Trello End-to-End Automation with Playwright & Jenkins

This is a complete **end-to-end automation testing framework** for Trello, built using **Playwright JS** and integrated with **Jenkins CI** and **Allure Reports**.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools

- ✅ [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) – For browser automation
- ✅ JavaScript (Node.js)
- ✅ Page Object Model (POM) – For scalable and reusable test architecture
- ✅ `.env` – For secure environment-based config management
- ✅ `.properties` – For dynamic test data handling
- ✅ [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) – For CI integration
- ✅ [Allure Reports](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/) – For beautiful test reporting

## 📐 Project Design

- **Page Object Model (POM):** All page-related locators and actions are organized into individual page classes for reuse.
- **Custom Fixtures:** Login and logout flows are handled using Playwright fixtures.
- **Config & Data:**  
  - `.env` file stores sensitive credentials.  
  - `test-data/*.properties` holds externalized test data.
